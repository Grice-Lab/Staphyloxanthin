# Staphyloxanthin paper 2023

This repository contains scripts which reproduce the analyses & figures for Campbell, McCready-Vangi et al.'s 2023 'Variable staphyloxanthin production by Staphylococcus aureus drives strain-dependent effects on diabetic wound healing outcomes'. With the exception of WGS data processing/assembly scripts which are in WholeGenomeSequencing with their own README, scripts are organized by figure # in the manuscript, where Figure Sn code is found at the end of Figure n code.
